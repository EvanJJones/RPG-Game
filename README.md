# RPG Game

## Purpose

This was made as a web based simple example of a combat system loosely derived from the SHin Megami Tensei Series.

## Instructions

Click an enemy to target them and then pick an attack type on the lower right. After you attack the enemies will attack you. If you guess the right attack type you will knock down the enemy and they won't be able to hurt you. Try and kill the enemies before they reduce your HP to zero.
