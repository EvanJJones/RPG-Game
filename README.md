# unit-4-game

## basic description
Simple rpg style game based around the basics of combat in the Shin Megami Tensei games. Try and guess the weaknesses of your enemies, when you correctly guess you knock them down so they can't attack you. try and kill al the enemies.

## premise / ideas

- RPG game with three enemies you need to face all at once
- All enemies attack at once, you need to use weaknesses to beat them
- Each enemy has a weakness to one of three types of attacks
  - when you attack an enemy with their weakness they lose a turn
- Each turn you pick an attack type and optionally a defensive stance
- you start off with one (or two?) attack type and gain one more after killing each of the first two enemies
- You need to figure out which enemy is weak to your attack
- each turn each enemy will have their intent over their head, you need to pick a defensive stance to counter that as well as use your attack to incapacitate one enmy to lower overall damage
  - can be thought of as two actions per turn
- enemies randomly pick from two types of attacks based on their type, will not attack with their weakness, use this to figure out their weakness potentially
- you will be unable to knowckdown one of the three enemies until you defeat one of the other two
- the last enemy needs some other advantage, potentially switching weaknesses randomly but their attacks telegraph that weakness. Maybe they can't get knowcked down as easily. Randomness?
- Three attacks type idea
- simplify this idea, I only have a few days to work on it, start with one attack where you pick who you are attacking.
